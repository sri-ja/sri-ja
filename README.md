## Hi! I am Srija Mukhopadhyay.

### Glad to see you here!

I am currently studying Computer Science and Computational Linguistics in the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. 

I like solving fun logical puzzles and learning new things.
Currently, I am exploring the domains of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and also looking more into the prospect of pursuing research in those fields - especially with an emphasis on Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing.
